#### Problem

Cloud security, server protection and vulnerability detection is one of the most important tasks every system andor security administrator should care about. There are a number of security issues and concerns associated with cloud computing, servers and websites. There is always some chance that even small bugs and typos in big programs can cause system anomalies in servers and websites, which can result to different undesirable side effects. Trying to regularly monitor system's work sometimes can be a very time-consuming and technically challenging task for every system administrator. Moreover, it is unreasonable for administrators to manually check system's activity and trying to detect bugs. Trying to overcome that difficulity in a standard way creates different types of technical challenges, which can be very overwhelming. So, what if there will be a software tool, which can complete all those tasks automatically and inform the administrator or even the user of the software system if there is some kind of anomaly 


#### Suggested Solution

In order to solve this problematic issue, one might suggest an automatic procedure that can regularly analyze the server's(website's) work and try to detect any kind of irregularities. When the tool detects any kind of anomaly it immidiately contacts the administratoruser to inform himher about the problem. Generally, for different types of software services one way to contact the administrator or the user is to send email notifications. The tool presented in this repo, however, uses a more convenient method, by sending a message to a user's phone that contains an information about the detected problem. Additionally, notifications by texting can work globally and people can recieve those messages from different corners of the word. The administratoruser can even choose the most convenient method for notifications(by email or by a texting).

#### Idea

The idea of this software tool was born during Cal Hacks Hackathon(October 3-5, 2014) at University of California, Berkeley. The software, which was developed by The Hill of Fingers team during the hackathon is designed to solve the problem discussed above. After researching the general idea of the popular software tool called Ping(Ping is a free software Linux-based live CD ISO image built upon the Partimage and Linux From Scratch (LFS) projects for disk cloning or backup purposes), the team decided to make another PaaS and SaaS tool, which will help people to increase the efficience of work with verious servers and websites. The project that you can find in this repository (httpsgithub.comRafa1994Pong) is just the initial beta version of the tool. The team is planning to continue the development of this tool and make it more advanced and widely functional in the near future.

#### Description of the Software Tool


Pong  is a Platform as a service and Software as a service tool for analyzing and monitoring changes in servers and websites. Ping can be a daily tool for every administrator or user for understanding the mysterious behavior of the system. You can find the Beta version of the software here httpspong-c9-mahnerak.c9.iologin . The effectiveness of this tool depends on the fact that it constantly tries to virtually keep in touch with its users. Basically, one of the main goals of this software is to check the functionality of various servers and websites. When the program finds that one of the functionalites of the server(website) is working improperly (for example - the actual return value of one function is different from expected outputs of that function), it automatically notifies the administrator. It can also be a very advanced administrative debugging tool. When the administrator wants to check the functionallity of one method, heshe can provide the testing function for cheching the generated results of the tested method and the software can do the remaining work by constantly(every 5 sec.) checking the outputs of the method. If Pong finds out that there is a contradiction it automaticaly sends a message to user's phone about the problem. Pong is also very useful for understanding if the execution of some parts of the system is not fast enough. 

Another important goal of this software tool is to inform about the executed updates in the system to the administrator. If the administrator wants to be informed about the changes in the status of some functionalities, the program can automatically check about the updates and inform the user after noticing the desired change. We don't claim to be perfect and the initial version of this program might contain some small bugs, because it is written during hackathon. However, the next versions of this tool will be more practical and will work more properly. In the future we are planning to add other important functionalities too. We are also thinking about creating the browser extension for this tool.

#### Advantages of this tool

Here we discuss some instances where Pong can be very useful.

1. Finding system anomalies - As you have already noticed the main task for Pong is to help the administrator to figure out bugs that are very hard to find manually. The examples described in Description of the Software Tool prove the fact that Pong can be a reliable tool for different types of monitoring tasks.


2. Getting updates from a your WebsiteBlog - Let's say you have your own website or blogg and you like to quickly recieve information about the updates of your websiteblog(such as new comments from different users). Instead of constantly checking your website every time, you can just simply use Pong. Pong helps to you get an information about the updates in the fastest way - by sending a message to your phone. 

3. Tracking the Shipping Updates - Let's say a user wants to keep track of the item which should be shipped from location A to location D, but there are some other locations between A and D(let's name them B and C). If our user wants to get notiefied when the item reaches the location B, heshe can simply let the program know about that fact. When the item reaches to point B and there will be an updates about that fact, the user will get a message that the item is already in location B.
